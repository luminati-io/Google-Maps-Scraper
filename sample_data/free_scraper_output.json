Don’t let the line deter you from trying Joe’s! The pizza is great as always and the staff are nice. Never disappointed. I tried the caprese pizza and it was great!\n\nThere are a lot of people inside and outside so it can get hectic, but turnover for seats is quite quick and I got a seat on the bench outside almost right away.",

I waited for over 1 hour and a half, was it worth it? Yes, definitely. It's definitely authentic Italian. You can buy a slice or a large pizza. There is a small selection of soft drinks, and the imported drinks were $4. Each it's a very popular place, they also offer delivery. It's a small restaurant, but it has an amazing atmosphere. Just watching the people making the pizzas and how they work in such a busy environment and how they work together under so much pressure was excellent.",

An estimated wait time for this visit was around 30-40 until we got our pizza, and that’s from the moment we got in line.\n\nSeating inside and standing outside available here, but you need to stay keen on the getting stools from those about to leave. There’s not enough stools inside and dining in is rather small.\n\nOutside there’s a covered stand where inside it has wall countertops. This area is also small but I like how Joe’s thought to add this because it does help.\n\nThe staff are dedicated and definitely busy making pizza pies for everyone. I observed staff going around and cleaning areas and replacing the plastic bowls they keep out for patrons to use: Parmesan cheese and spices.\n\nThe pizza itself comes out hot so be prepared for that. We had a pepperoni cheese pizza and it was good. You just need to be patient and while you wait snag up those stools!\n\nI’d definitely come back 💯",

Super small restaurant with minimal space to dine but we managed. The atmosphere is worth visiting.  The pictures on the wall let you know how popular this place is.

Living in the Philadelphia area, I guess I’m conditioned with all the wonderful authentic Italian places.  It’s very cramped inside and the line didn’t move as fast as expected.  I was about 50 in line and I waited maybe 45 minutes.  So it was good but I wouldn’t wait this long again for it.",
